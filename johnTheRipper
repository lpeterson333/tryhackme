Notes for TryHackMe | John The Ripper room

Jumbo John is installed by default on Kali Linux.  Type john in terminal to check. 
On Kali wordlists are in the /usr/share/wordlists directory. 

Word lists for dictionary attacks can be found at SecLists github repo:
https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists
The famous rockyou.txt word list is found at:
https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases
It may be extracted from .tar.gz format using tar xvzf rockyou.txt.tar.gz

Example usage without specifying the type of hash:
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash_to_crack.txt

To identify the hash type first can use hash-identifier python file which can be downloaded to kali using this command:
wget https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/hash-identifier/-/raw/kali/master/hash-id.py
and then launch it with:
python3 hash-id.py
and the hash you want to identify.

Then to use john the ripper with an identified hash type, follow this example:
john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash_to_crack.txt

NTLM
You can acquire NTHash/NTLM hashes by dumping the SAM database on a Windows machine, 
by using a tool like Mimikatz or from the Active Directory database: NTDS.dit. 
You may not have to crack the hash to continue privilege escalation- 
as you can often conduct a "pass the hash" attack instead, 
but sometimes hash cracking is a viable option if there is a weak password policy

in order to crack /etc/shadow passwords, you must combine it 
with the /etc/passwd file in order for John to understand the data it's being given. 
To do this, we use a tool built into the John suite of tools called unshadow.
example: unshadow local_passwd local_shadow > unshadowed.txt

When using unshadow, you can either use the entire /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow file-
if you have them available, or you can use the relevant line from each

Custom rules are defined in the john.conf file, usually located in /etc/john/john.conf
Custom rules wiki is located here: https://www.openwall.com/john/doc/RULES.shtml
for a rule name PoloPassword create it like this:
[List.Rules:PoloPassword]
cAz"[0-9] [!Â£$%@]" //whatever regex rule needed

 Password Protected Zip Files
 zip2john tool to convert the zip file into a hash format that John is able to understand
 example: zip2john zipfile.zip > zip_hash.txt
